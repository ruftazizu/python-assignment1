#The surface of the earth is curved, and the distance between degrees of longitude varies with latitude.
#As a result, finding the distance between two points on the surface of the earth is more complicated than simply using the Pythagorean theorem.
#The equation for finding the distance between two points on the surface of the earth in kilometers is given by:
#distance = 6371.01 \times arccos(sin(lat_1) \times sin(lat_2)+cos(lat_1)\times cos(lat_2)\times cos(long_1-long_2))
#where: $(lat_1, long_1)$ and $(lat_2,long_2) $ are the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earthâ€™s surface.
#Create a program that allows the user to enter the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earth in degrees.
#Your program should display the distance between the points in kilometers.
#Also assuming we travel using an aeroplane that is moving at a minimum speed of 740 km/h how long will it take us to travel that distance?
